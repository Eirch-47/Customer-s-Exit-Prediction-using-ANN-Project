Introduction to the Problem:

The problem of customer churn in banks is introduced. Customer churn refers to customers leaving the bank.
The goal is to build a model to predict which customers are likely to leave, allowing the bank to take proactive measures.

Data Preparation:

The dataset includes various features such as customer ID, credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, has credit card, is active member, estimated salary, and whether they exited.
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (e.g., geography and gender), and feature scaling to normalize the data.

Building the Artificial Neural Network (ANN):

The ANN architecture consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
The input layer takes in the features of the dataset.
Hidden layers consist of neurons that apply weights and biases to the inputs and pass them through activation functions (commonly ReLU).
The output layer provides the final prediction, typically using a sigmoid activation function for binary classification (churn or not churn).

Training the Model:

The model is compiled with an optimizer (e.g., Adam), a loss function (binary_crossentropy for binary classification), and metrics to evaluate performance (e.g., accuracy).
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train the model and evaluate its performance.
The model is trained over several epochs, adjusting weights and biases to minimize the loss function.

Evaluating the Model:

Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix are used to evaluate the model.
The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing insight into the model's performance.

Making Predictions:


The trained model is used to make predictions on new data.


Conclusion:

It emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing, model evaluation, and the practical applications of such a model for banks.
Provides code examples in Python, using libraries like Keras and TensorFlow, to illustrate each step of the process.
